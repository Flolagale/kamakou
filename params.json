Source it to reload it (or simpler, close and re-open Vim) and run the:\r\n\r\n```VimL\r\n    :BundleInstall\r\n```\r\n\r\ncommand to automatically clone this repository into your home.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can copy the kamakou.vim file in your ```~/.vim/colors``` folder on unix system,<br>\r\nor in ```%HOMEPATH%\\vimfiles\\colors``` on Windows.\r\n\r\n###Todo...\r\nImprove 256 colors terminal support. Forks and help appreciated...\r\n\r\n[Vim]:http://vim.org\r\n[Vundle]:http://github.com/gmarik/vundle\r\n[molokai]:http://github.com/tomasr/molokai\r\n[mustang]:http://hcalves.deviantart.com/art/Mustang-Vim-Colorscheme-98974484"}
